## About This Repository
This repository is part of one of the two main repositories related to:

**‚ÄúCross-Sectoral Trend Analysis in Additive Manufacturing: Deriving Insights into Business-Relevant Topics, Use Cases, and Technology Trends Through Data Mining.‚Äù**

It focuses on the data cleaning, LLM-based inference, and post-inference data analysis stages of the research workflow. The notebooks and scripts in this repository support tasks such as text preprocessing, exploratory and time-series analysis, LLM-based text classification and sentiment analysis, as well as post-inference evaluation and result interpretation.

Since many of the datasets used are quite large, they have been moved out of the repository and are hosted externally.
